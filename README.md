This project involves building an application with authentication functionality, allowing users to register and log in using their email and password. Once logged in, users can upload images to use as display pictures for their contacts. The application also provides features to add, update, and delete contacts, including the ability to change their display pictures.

Additionally, users can add, update, and delete profile links for individual contacts. The application allows users to search for contacts by name or profile links, making it easy to find specific contacts in the list.

To enhance user experience, the application includes toast notifications for various actions such as adding, updating, or deleting contacts. It also displays a welcome message upon successful registration or login.

Users have the option to switch between dark mode and light mode, and their preference is saved using local storage, ensuring that the selected mode persists across sessions. The user interface of the application is designed to be responsive, providing optimal viewing and interaction experiences across different screen sizes.

Overall, this project involves creating an application with authentication, image uploading, contact management, search functionality, toast notifications, dark mode toggle, and a responsive user interface.
